# Hello, world!

👋 I'm a recent Bachelor's graduate in Computer Science. I have 3 years professional experience working with startups and scaleups in Amsterdam and Jakarta.

👀 I primarily develop Frontend, using React with Next.js, or Vue.js with Nuxt.js. I work with Tailwind, and my earlier work uses vanilla CSS with SASS. 

🌱 I'm currently developing backend projects, creating RESTful APIs and learning Data Modeling.
