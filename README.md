# Hello, world!

😁 I'm Guivari, and I love UI/UX. I mean, GUI is literally in my name!

👋 I'm a recent Bachelor's graduate in Computer Science. I am a Full Stack Engineer with expertise in Front End development.

👀 I look forward to learning new things, though currently I focus on Vue3, Node, React, SQL, C++.

🌱 I'm currently learning Data Engineering and Machine Learning development.

🫰 I look forward to collaborating on challenging projects, and developing myself as a developer!
